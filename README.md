[For auth0 refer to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQwo4E_B0y8. It is done in BACKEND, so react is not required].

a. [If SaaS Login] - add the email and name to the customer table if it is not already exists.\
b. [SasS or Local login] - display all the shop orders of the customer with customer name, item name, item quantity and shipping date. (Note, this query will involve 3
